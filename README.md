# Libraries & Stylesheets

Here are the libraries that helped in the development of this small app:

* [jsmidgen](https://github.com/dingram/jsmidgen) Handles the MIDI format and structure
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) Handles file-saving on Client-side.
* [Bootstrap CSS Grid](http://getbootstrap.com) My favorite boilerplate for grid-system (I think there are still some unnecessary CSS in there, but I'll take care of that later)
